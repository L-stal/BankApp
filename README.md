# Bank Console App
A simple bank application for console , made for a school project.


# "Features" 

 -  Sign in to existing accounts
-   Have multiple bank accounts
-   View account balances 
-   Make deposits and withdrawals 

# Reflections 
I have a lot of things i would do different , i use a lot of else ifs to catch errors and the menu choices are numbers instead of letting the user us the arrow keys to navigate through menus.
I did not know how to save to a txt file when i started but i learned half way though so instead of hard coding the accounts and founds i would like to let the user create account and input the funds for them self so the accounts and funds are saved between runs.

# Special thanks.
