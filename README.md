# Bank Console App
A simple bank application for console, made for a school project.


# "Features" 

 -  Sign in to existing accounts
-   Have multiple bank accounts
-   View account balances 
-   Make deposits and withdrawals 

# Reflections 
I have a lot of things I would do differently, I use a lot of else ifs to catch errors and the menu choices are numbers instead of letting the user use the arrow keys to navigate through menus.
I did not know how to save to a text file when I started but I learned half way through so instead of hard coding the accounts and funds I would like to let the user create an account and input the funds for themselves so the accounts and funds are saved between runs.

# Special thanks.

To @ChrisVasa for being my rubber duck! Big help, much appreciated.
